Epicals – Diabetes Risk Predictor

Epicals – Diabetes Risk Predictor is a machine learning based application designed to predict the risk of diabetes using key medical parameters. The project focuses on early risk identification using supervised learning techniques and demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare.

Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze patient health data and predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes. This helps in understanding how machine learning models can assist in early-stage medical risk assessment.

Features

• Predicts diabetes risk based on medical inputs
• Uses machine learning classification algorithms
• Compares Logistic Regression and Random Forest models
• Includes model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
• Uses feature scaling for improved performance
• Provides real-time predictions using a deployed Streamlit application

Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Random Forest is selected as the final model due to higher accuracy and better feature importance interpretation.

Dataset Description

The dataset consists of medical attributes commonly used for diabetes diagnosis:

• Pregnancies
• Glucose Level
• Blood Pressure
• Skin Thickness
• Insulin
• Body Mass Index (BMI)
• Diabetes Pedigree Function
• Age

Target Variable:
0 – Non-Diabetic
1 – Diabetic
